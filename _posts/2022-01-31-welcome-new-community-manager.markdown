Hi Zarr Community! My name is Sanket Verma and I'm the new Community Manager for Zarr Project. I hail from New Delhi, India. I'm so excited to be part of this wonderful community and look forward to working with all you.

A bit about myself, I've been part of the PyData ecosystem for the past 5 years. I've been leading the PyData Delhi meetup chapter for the past 5 years and since then we've organised 40+ meetups along with 3 in-person conferences. I've also had the generous opportunity to be the Executive Chair for PyData Global 2020 & 2021 conference and have worked closely with NumFOCUS for a long period of time.
