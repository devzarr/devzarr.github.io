Pre-release version `2.12.0a1` of the [Zarr Python package](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python) has been released! 🎉

This blog post aims to overview new features, especially newly added support for reading and writing to Zarr V3 arrays. Zarr V3 is the upcoming evolved format for storing N-dimensional chunked compressed arrays, which is succeeded by Zarr V2. This blog also highlights other enhancements like creating `FSStore` from an existing fsspec filesystem, performance improvement for Zarr arrays when appending data to S3, bug fixes, documentation and a maintenance fix.

## Add suport for reading and writing Zarr V3

This version provides the infrastructure for reading and writing the upcoming V3 spec of the Zarr format. The new `zarr._store.v3` package has the necessary classes and functions for evaluating Zarr V3. Since the design is not finalised, the classes and functions are not automatically imported into the regular Zarr namespace. However, setting the `ZARR_V3_API_AVAILABLE` environment will activate them.

The pre-release can be installed via: `pip install —pre zarr`.

There have been significant changes to [Zarr’s Python](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python) codebase to implement V3 functionality. I’d be highlighting some of the main changes here:

- A new function is added in `store.py`, which verifies that a key conforms to the [V3 specification](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/).
- Added function in `store.py` to ensure internally that Zarr stores are always a class with a specific interface derived from `Store`, which is slightly different from `MutableMapping`.
- Separating `metadata` files from the data (arrays). Previously metadata and arrays were stored together in a consolidated group known as `.zgroup`.
- Changes in `convenience.py` to use Zarr V3. The default value is `None`; it will attempt to infer the version from `store` if possible; otherwise, it will fall back to V2.
- Consolidating all metadata for groups and arrays within the given store into a single resource and putting it under the given key. The changes can be seen [here](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/blob/b9b9bf9e0577380222f2d7871e5272d8dfff9723/zarr/convenience.py#L1163) in `convenience.py`.
- Modification in `creation.py`, which enables the creation of an array using Zarr V3. If `None`, it will be inferred from `store` or `chunk_store`; otherwise defaults to V2.
- Updated `meta.py` with the new V3 data types links. The V3 data types are listed [here](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/extensions/data-types.html).
- New tests added for all the new and modified features!


These are some high-level changes that I’ve tried to list here. If you’re interested in browsing through all of the code changes, please refer to PR [#898](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/898).

The work on V3 was done by [Gregory Lee](https://github.com/grlee77) and was funded by the [CZI](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/). The Zarr Community extends their wholesome gratitude to Gregory for completing this! 🙌🏻

## Appending performance improvement

The old implementation iterated through all the `old` chunks and removed those that didn’t exist in the `new` chunks. As a result, it led to significant time delays when appending data to Zarr arrays in cloud services like S3.

The new and improved implementation will iterate through each dimension and only find and remove the chunk slices in `old` but not in `new` data. It also introduced a mutable list to dynamically adjust the number of chunks along the already-processed dimensions to avoid duplicate chunk removal.

This improvement was added by [hailiangzhang](https://github.com/hailiangzhang) with PR [#1014](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/1014).

## Other enhancements

- If you have created a fsspec filesystem outside of Zarr, you can now pass it as a keyword argument to `FSStore`.

This feature was added by [Ryan Abernathy](https://github.com/rabernat) with PR [#911](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/911).

- Added number encoder for `json.dumps` to support NumPy integers in `chunks` arguments. 

This enhancement was added by [Eric Prostate](https://github.com/ericpre) with PR [#933](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/933) and the issue was raised by [Mark Dickinson](https://github.com/mdickinson) with [#697](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/issues/697).

## Bugs, Documentation and Maintenance

Fix bug that made it impossible to create an FSStore on unlistable filesystems (e.g. some HTTP servers) by [Ryan Abernathey](https://github.com/rabernat); [#993](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/issues/993).

Update resize doc to clarify surprising behaviour by [hailiangzhang](https://github.com/hailiangzhang); [#1022](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/1022).

Pre-commit configuration now includes `YAML` check by [Shivank Chaudhary](https://github.com/Alt-Shivam); [#1015](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/issues/1015) & [#1016](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/issues/1016).
