Hi Zarr Community! My name is [Sanket Verma](https://twitter.com/msankeys963) and I‚Äôm excited to share that I‚Äôm the new Community Manager for the Zarr project. I hail from New
Delhi, India. I‚Äôm so excited to be part of this wonderful community and look forward to working with all of you.

[Zarr steering council](https://github.com/zarr-developers/governance/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md) consists of wonderful humans and I‚Äôm thankful for the smooth interview and
onboarding process. I‚Äôd like to mention [Josh Moore](https://github.com/joshmoore), [Alistair Miles](https://github.com/alimanfoo) and [John Kirkham](https://github.com
jakirkham) for a smooth interview and onboarding process.

A bit about myself, I graduated from [Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, Delhi](http://ipu.ac.in/) with a major in [Computer Science & Engineering](http://www.ipu.ac.i
/usict/syllabus/syll4probtechcst261121.pdf). I‚Äôve been heavily involved with the PyData ecosystem and have been super active with the community building and fostering of
PyData culture throughout the Indian region. [PyData Delhi](https://www.meetup.com/pydatadelhi/) organised the first PyData conference in India back in [2017](https://pydata.org/delhi2017/) which led to the foundation of many new PyData chapters throughout the country. Since 2017, I have chaired 3 [PyData Delhi conferences](https://pydata.org/delhi2019/) and organised 40+ meet-ups throughout Delhi-NCR. I‚Äôve also had the generous opportunity to be the Executive Chair for the [PyData Global 2020](https://pydataglobal.github.io/pages/organizers) and [2021](https://pydata.org/global2021/about/#committee) conferences. I‚Äôve been involved with NumFOCUS for a long period and
have recently been awarded [NumFOCUS Community Leadership Award](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aFmftHlsy_5k44S5SrsFM2gywqh4L_ku/view?usp=sharing) for my efforts. 

In the past, I‚Äôve worked on several interesting things. I worked as a Research and Development Engineer at [Forensic Science Lab, Government of India](http://fsl.delhi.gov.in/)
where I developed software for the Ballistics department which helped the authorities in the accelerated prosecution of criminals. 

>A brief about my research: Every firearm imparts a unique fingerprint to every bullet and shell fired from it. These fingerprints are known as [striations and riflings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_firearm_examination). The software we developed essentially compares the microscopic images of bullets and shells obtained from the
different crime scenes and matches them for similarity. If the evidence(images) from different crime scenes matches with each other then we can evidently and factually say
that the same firearm was used in the crimes involved. After analysing the additional evidence we could safely say that the criminal cases were linked to each other.

After that, I was involved with a [startup](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hybrid-idea-solutions/) where we developed assistive tech for differently-abled. I also have
experience working with a [multinational organisation](https://www.dunnhumby.com/) in a research position where I made production-ready software in the field of NLP. Recently,
I worked with an [organisation](https://gramener.com/) where I worked on adding NLP features to their product. I also helped them in organising community events and advising
the product team to align the development of their product for better adoption by OSS communities.

>Why did I join Zarr?

Throughout my career, I was involved with working on technical projects, research and community building which I think are bigger than myself. I‚Äôve always loved to work on
things that help others and give back to society. Open-source and communities are such places where you have this wonderful privilege to help others and make tools for a
better tomorrow. I also believe that in open-source, individual contributions does not only help you but also others on their journey.

Zarr seemed like a perfect place for me to work on what I believe. I think being a young project Zarr needed someone with experience in handling and working with the
communities. 


Apart from technical and community engagements I love to read sci-fi, cosmology and fantasy books. I‚Äôm also a huge Marvel fan(comics and movies). I like thrillers, horror,
sci-fi and fantasy movies and T.V. shows. I‚Äôm blessed to be not far from the magnificent Himalayas and go on mountain treks a few times a year. To keep up with my trekking
fitness, I run and cycle.

It‚Äôs more than a week since I officially joined Zarr as a community manager. I have been talking regularly with the steering council, reading about the project, going through
the Github repos and have planned a few things for upcoming months:

- [x] Setup new [blog](https://zarr.dev/blog/)
- Improve the social media presence of Zarr
- Highlight new research, implementations and projects which uses Zarr
- Regular maintenance and keeping check of all [repositories under Zarr](https://github.com/zarr-developers/)
- Work on [community feedback process](https://github.com/zarr-developers/governance/issues/14)
- Work on [Zarr spec v3](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/core-protocol-v3.0-dev/protocol/core/v3.0.html)

and much more! I‚Äôll be writing a separate blog for Zarr‚Äôs roadmap in a few weeks and the status of my progress.

I look forward to interacting and working with all of you. Please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out to me with any questions/comments or maybe some good memes! üòè
